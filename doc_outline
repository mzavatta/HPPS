1 INTRODUCTION
- Reasons behind automation of the design flow: fast exploration of different architectures at a very detailed level (if the whole flow automatized can collect very precise data)
- Objective of the work: automatize a piece of the flow i.e. generation of the platform files

2 XILINX DESIGN FLOW AND TOOLS
- very brief on xilinx methodology (hdl sources -> definition of the platform ->
synthesis (netlist) -> implementation -> bitstream)
- HW and SW platforms (EDK)
    - processors, available IPs and custom IPs, buses... drivers etc..
    - EDK platform specification format: mhs, mpd, mss...
- partial reconfiguration (PlanAhead)

3 THE TOOL
- refined objective: detailed assumptions on the xml and other input files and details of the output files
- platform used as a reference and testing (2 microblaze, 2 plbs...)
- design choices (default parameters files and information from mpd to achieve flexibility)
- implementation details (data structures used, naming etc..)
- how to use it

4 EXTENSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
- automatic generation of the bitstream from the platform specification (bypass EDK + PlanAhead)
